# Job-Web-Scrapper
This is a partially finished Job Web Scrapper 

Few things to note about this web scrapper.

The idea is to use a custom google search to find many postings of workable jobs.
After the list of workable jobs has been obtained then I would filter out jobs that I do find needed and add them to large list of jobs with important data oulled as well.
The final list is saved as list.csv and can be imported to Excel or google sheets very easily.
